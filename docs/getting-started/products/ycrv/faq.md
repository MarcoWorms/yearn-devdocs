## FAQ

### Launch and Migration

#### When will yCRV launch?
TBD - no date set yet. All contracts are live, but due to how rewards work, some coordination is required to ensure all users are migrated without missing rewards.

#### Should I migrate now?
No. Wait until the migration date, when incentives move to the new system otherwise you will not have exposure to them.

#### What happens to yveCRV and yvBOOST?
yveCRV and yvBOOST are being deprecated, and there is a migration path available to users. yCRV can be minted 1:1 from yveCRV. yCRV can be minted `1 * pricePerShare` of yvBOOST at the time of migration. There will be a migration zap available to all users to make this easy.

#### Will I get rewards if I don't migrate?
No. After the cut-over date, all incentives will move to the new yCRV system.

#### Is there a deadline for migration?
Nope! You can migrate anytime in the future. Contracts are trustless and migrations cannot be stopped.
