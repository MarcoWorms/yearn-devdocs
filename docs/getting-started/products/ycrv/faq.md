## Launch and Migration

### When will yCRV launch?
Contracts are live, you can find relevant addresses [here](https://docs.yearn.finance/getting-started/products/ycrv/overview#addresses).

### Should I migrate now from yveCRV and yvBOOST?
Yes! Incentives have moved to the new system. yveCRV and yvBOOST will no longer receive yield.

### What happens to yveCRV and yvBOOST?
yveCRV and yvBOOST are being deprecated, and there is a migration path available to users. yCRV can be minted 1:1 from yveCRV. yCRV can be minted `1 * pricePerShare` of yvBOOST at the time of migration. There will be a migration zap available to all users to make this easy.

### Will I get rewards if I don't migrate?
No. After the cut-over date, all incentives will move to the new yCRV system.

### Is there a deadline for migration?
Nope! You can migrate anytime in the future. Contracts are trustless and migrations cannot be stopped.
